*This is a Midterm project for ML Zoomcamp 2022*

# Heart failure clinical records

## Purpose of the project is to try to predict the probability of a patient to die in certain circumstances.

Heart failures are a very common cause of death.

The dataset contains 299 records of patients with heart failure ([Data Dictionnary](#data-dictionnary)). 

Each record describe the conditions of the patient and indication if the failure has caused death or not.
The idea is to try to identify the main factors causing the death and develop several models able to predict it.

- First the data were analysed to identify the main features.
- Then several models have been developed and fine tuned (parameters tuning).
- The best model (xgboost) after re-trained was exported and containerized using bentoml/docker.
- Docker image has been pushed to DockerHub and implemented in the could as a service.
- Progress are detailled in a series of consecutives jupyter notebooks ([Project](#project)).
